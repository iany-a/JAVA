JDK - JAVA development kit - for coding and debugging

JRE - for running the app



JAVA 17



Shortcut: 

psvm -> public static void main

syso -> System.out.println()



everything in JAVA is passed by value in param. list

no copy constructor in JAVA but clone methods are used



objects are being assigned unique IDs automatically



Debugger criteria:

-step over -> execute the entire instruction fct(x) = *atomic instruction*

e.g.; x++; 1 incrementation step, DONE

-step into -> don't execute fct(x) but go over it instead



1st step somewhere around Easter, and another one at the end.

Attendence mandatory
